 
## PHPStorm Setup and Plugins ##
I find PHPStorm to be one of the best IDEs out there, following are a list of nice setups, shortcuts and plugins.

## Shortcuts (Default keys are assumed)
### Bookmarks
Bookmarks is used to jump between lines of code within a project, it is extremely useful if you code between two files etc.
`Ctrl+F11` Create Bookmark
`Ctrl+F12` View Bookmarks (Can delete from here too)
`Ctrl+Up/Down` Shift Bookmarks up or down

### General
`Ctrl+Tab` Jump to any of a list of opened files.
`Ctrl+E` Navigate to recent file.
`Ctrl+Space` Basic code completion.
`Ctrl+Alt+N` Refactor code (custom keys)
`ctrl+/` Comment/uncomment current line or selected block with line comments
`shift+ctrl+/` Comment/uncomment code with block comments 

### AceJump
Jump to any part of the code without using the mouse.
`Ctrl+Semicolon` Then press a letter of the word you would want to jump to, it will then give you a lettered index to press next and it will then jump to that word.
`Hold-Shift+Indexed Letter` to highlight to that word.
`(While index shows)Enter` to further expand the indexes.
